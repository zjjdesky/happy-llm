## 🎯 Project Introduction

> &emsp;&emsp;*Many friends felt unsatisfied after reading the Datawhale open-source project: [self-llm Open Source Large Model Usage Guide](https://github.com/datawhalechina/self-llm), wanting to deeply understand the principles and training processes of large language models. Therefore, we (Datawhale) decided to launch the "Happy-LLM" project, aiming to help everyone deeply understand the principles and training processes of large language models.*

&emsp;&emsp;This project is a **systematic LLM learning tutorial** that starts from basic NLP research methods and gradually deepens according to LLM concepts and principles, systematically analyzing the architectural foundations and training processes of LLMs for readers. At the same time, we will combine the most mainstream code frameworks in the current LLM field to demonstrate how to build and train an LLM from scratch, aiming to achieve "give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." We hope everyone can start their journey into the vast world of LLMs from this book and explore the endless possibilities of LLMs.

## 💡 How to Learn

&emsp;&emsp;This project is suitable for university students, researchers, and LLM enthusiasts. Before learning this project, it is recommended to have some programming experience, especially familiarity with the Python programming language. It's best to have knowledge of deep learning and understand concepts and terminology in the NLP field to learn this project more easily.

&emsp;&emsp;This project is divided into two parts - foundational knowledge and practical applications. Chapters 1-4 are the foundational knowledge section, introducing the basic principles of LLMs from shallow to deep. Chapter 1 briefly introduces basic NLP tasks and development, providing reference for non-NLP field researchers; Chapter 2 introduces the basic architecture of LLMs - Transformer, including principle introduction and code implementation, serving as the most important theoretical foundation for LLMs; Chapter 3 comprehensively introduces classic PLMs, including Encoder-Only, Encoder-Decoder, and Decoder-Only architectures, while also introducing the architectures and concepts of some current mainstream LLMs; Chapter 4 formally enters the LLM section, detailing the characteristics, capabilities, and overall training process of LLMs. Chapters 5-7 are the practical application section, gradually leading everyone into the underlying details of LLMs. Chapter 5 will guide readers to build an LLM from scratch based on PyTorch and implement the full pipeline of pre-training and supervised fine-tuning; Chapter 6 will introduce the current industry-mainstream LLM training framework Transformers, guiding learners to quickly and efficiently implement the LLM training process based on this framework; Chapter 7 will introduce various applications based on LLMs, completing learners' understanding of the LLM system, including LLM evaluation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the concepts and simple implementation of intelligent agents (Agents). You can selectively read relevant chapters based on personal interests and needs.

&emsp;&emsp;During the reading process, it is recommended to combine theory with practice. LLM is a rapidly developing, practice-oriented field. We recommend investing more in hands-on practice, reproducing the various codes provided in this book, while actively participating in LLM-related projects and competitions, truly diving into the wave of LLM development. We encourage you to follow Datawhale and other LLM-related open-source communities. When encountering problems, you can ask questions in the issue section of this project at any time.

&emsp;&emsp;Finally, we welcome every reader to join the ranks of LLM developers after learning this project. As a domestic AI open-source community, we hope to fully gather co-creators to enrich this open-source LLM world together and create more comprehensive and distinctive LLM tutorials. Sparks gather into an ocean. We hope to become a bridge between LLMs and the general public, embracing a more magnificent and vast LLM world with the spirit of free and equal open source.
